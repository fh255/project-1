            World longest beach - Cox's Bazar <i class="fa-solid fa-umbrella-beach"></i>
        </h2>
        <p>
            The city is located over 150 km south of the port city of Chittagong on
            the Bay of Bengal and is the administrative headquarters of the Cox's
            Bazar district. কক্সবাজার was named after the British officer Hiram Cox,
            who worked for the East India Company; Lieutenant Cox died in the town
            in 1798.<br />
            Cox's Bazar lies on a coastal plain in the southeastern corner of
            Bangladesh. It is located 150km south of the industrial port of
            Chittagong. It takes nearly an hour flying or about four hours by bus
            travelling nearly 400km from the capital Dhaka.
            <br />
            Stretching a remarkable length of more than 120km, Cox's Bazar is the
            longest natural sea beach in the world and was nominated as one of the
            “New 7 Wonders of Nature” in 2008. Most of Cox's Bazar is 200m wide at
            high tide, and 400m wide at low tide. This Bay of Bengal beach is a
            popular tourist spot attracting droves of locals and foreign tourists,
            even in off season.
