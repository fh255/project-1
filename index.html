            World longest beach, Cox's Bazar, a must-visit place in Bangladesh
        </h2>
        <p>
        The city is located over 150 km south of the port city of Chittagong on the Bay of Bengal and is the administrative
        headquarters of the Cox's Bazar district. কক্সবাজার was named after the British officer Hiram Cox, who worked for the
        East India Company; Lieutenant Cox died in the town in 1798.<br>
        Cox's Bazar lies on a coastal plain in the southeastern corner of Bangladesh. It is located 150km south of the
        industrial port of Chittagong. It takes nearly an hour flying or about four hours by bus travelling nearly 400km from
        the capital Dhaka.
        <br>
        Stretching a remarkable length of more than 120km, Cox's Bazar is the longest natural sea beach in the world and was
        nominated as one of the “New 7 Wonders of Nature” in 2008.
        Most of Cox's Bazar is 200m wide at high tide, and 400m wide at low tide. This Bay of Bengal beach is a popular tourist
        spot attracting droves of locals and foreign tourists, even in off season.
